synopsis: Type-safe EDSL for SQL queries on persistent backends.
description: This version is a beta release that works with the persistent-2.0 beta.
             .
             @esqueleto@ is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries
             that works with unmodified @persistent@ SQL backends.  Its
             language closely resembles SQL, so you don't have to learn
             new concepts, just new syntax, and it's fairly easy to
             predict the generated SQL and optimize it for your backend.
             Most kinds of errors committed when writing SQL are caught as
             compile-time errors---although it is possible to write
             type-checked @esqueleto@ queries that fail at runtime.
             .
             @persistent@ is a library for type-safe data serialization.  It
             has many kinds of backends, such as SQL backends
             (@persistent-mysql@, @persistent-postgresql@,
             @persistent-sqlite@) and NoSQL backends (@persistent-mongoDB@).
             While @persistent@ is a nice library for storing and retrieving
             records, including with filters, it does not try to support
             some of the features that are specific to SQL backends.  In
             particular, @esqueleto@ is the recommended library for
             type-safe @JOIN@s on @persistent@ SQL backends.  (The
             alternative is using raw SQL, but that's error prone and does
             not offer any composability.)
             .
             Currently, @SELECT@s, @UPDATE@s, @INSERT@s and @DELETE@s are supported.
             Not all SQL features are available, but most of them can be easily added
             (especially functions), so please open an issue or send a pull request if
             you need anything that is not covered by @esqueleto@ on
             <https://github.com/prowdsponsor/esqueleto/>.
             .
             The name of this library means \"skeleton\" in Portuguese and
             contains all three SQL letters in the correct order =).  It was
             inspired by Scala's Squeryl but created from scratch.
